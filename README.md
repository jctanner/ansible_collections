# ansible_collections

This repo is purely for educational purposes and to demonstrate the structure of collections by using all of the modules currently shipped in ansible/ansible.

The files were created by https://github.com/jctanner/gravity/blob/master/build_collections.py

These collections are also a testbed for https://github.com/jctanner/ansible-sdk/blob/master/README.md
